With the make target synth, additional code is downloaded for synthesis. This code
is fetched from https://github.com/Digilent/Nexys-4-DDR-OOB. For this code no 
license is available. Therefore the need to fetch it. The files which are needed are
the src/hdl/ directory and named:
TWICtl.vhd
TempSensorCtl.vhd 

The patch files are located in ./patches. Furthermore the files in question are only 
available during synthesis and deleted afterwards.

This design is created to display the temperature on a Nexys4 DDR Board. It is created with the purpose to get the temperature and to pass the digital integrated circuits laboratory at the Technical University of Vienna. It utilizes an AMBA APB Bus interface for communication between the separate parts.


DIRECTORIES
Within 
./bin - you'll find the generated bitstream,
./doc - latex source for the documentation,
./patches - the patch files which are needed for synthesis,
./sim - files needed for the simulation,
./sim/simout - generated .vcd files from the simulation,
./src - the design source files and 
./synth - needed scripts for the synthesis and the working directory for vivado.


PRE-REQUISITES
To use the design you need Vivado version 2017.4 for the synthesis and to program the FPGA-Board. Maybe works with other versions too, but it is only tested with this version. Furthermore to use the simulation you need ghdl and gtkwave installed. 

To generate the documentation you'll also need latex, the font-libraries, the tikz-libraries and biber installed.

USAGE
To instantiate the core you can simply instantiate the AMBA_digitherm.vhd file which lies within the ./src directory. The parameters are as follows: The clockfreqency in Hz and the samplerate which determines the amount of samples per second.

MAKEFILE TARGETS
sim - generates the simulation .vcd files to view with gtkwave
synth - synthezises the design and creates the bitstream
prog - takes the bitstream and writes it onto the Nexys4DDR board
doc - generates the documentation 
clean - cleans up and deletes generated bitstreams, all the documentation output and the files created for simulation

GENERICS
clockfrequency: The clockfrequency of the board in Hz. Is needed to make the counting right.
samples: The amount of samples per second.
num_slaves: The number of slaves in the digitherm design.
bus_size: The size of the bus lines to and from the slaves.

Some data for the design on the Nexys 4 DDR board:
Power consumption: 105mW
